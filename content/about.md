## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/img/avatar.jpg" alt="Nikolaj Sidorenco avatar">}}

I am a PhD student at the department of computer science at Aarhus University.
My supervisor is [Bas Spitters](https://users-cs.au.dk/spitters/ "Bas Spitters").

## Research Interest

I'm interested in the intersection between formal verification and cryptography.
In particular, I'm interested in formally proving (probabilistic) security properties of programs with the help of proof assistants.
Lately, I have been working with both EasyCrypt and Coq.
The special class of programs I'm interested in involve either zero-knowledge and/or multi-party computations.
